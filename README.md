Gedcom.js is a simple javascript library for parsing GEDCOM files.  Current version is targeting only Node.JS but shouldn't be too bad to make it work in a browser as well.

This project is based off https://github.com/madprime/python-gedcom.

NOTE
====
I am not a JavaScript guy but needed this for a node.js project I am working on in my spare time.  If the code is not good, please let me know =).
